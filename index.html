    	</h2>
		<p>
            For my senior project, I have created a device that tracks a user’s motions as they draw in midair. The device resembles a pair of eyes that follow the user as they draw. This project was built on a Raspberry Pi and ESP32 using a Raspberry Pi camera and the OpenCV computer vision library. My original intent for the senior project was to build something that would enable some artistic purpose and that would allow me to increase my understanding of embedded systems.  This system uses color-based object detection to identify the user’s drawing motions. This means that a user must draw with a tool whose color has already been identified and calibrated for before beginning the motion tracking sequence. Mini servos were used for actuation and the enclosure is built out of wood and 3D printed eyeballs.
